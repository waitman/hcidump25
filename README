This version modified to build on FreeBSD 11.0-Current by Waitman Gobble <ns@waitman.net>

uses BSD Makefile.

# make

# make clean

No install at the moment. It currently reports error:

# ./hcidump
HCI sniffer - Bluetooth packet analyzer ver 2.5
Can't open device: Protocol not supported

However, you can read the RAW packet files which have been created by hcidump 
in ports. The reason you may wish to do this is because there are some minor 
issues in the older version of hcidump in the FreeBSD ports tree. One issue 
with the older version is that it does not seem to properly continue subsequent 
packets when the MTU is set smaller than the response size, which generates 
syntax errors.
